<div class="plaintext">

<p>At the beginning of the <span id=”mention-145” class=”mention-event” about=”2010s” data-label=”2010s”>2010s</span>, the world seemed to be poised for an <span id=”mention-215” class=”mention-event” about=”EbookRevolution” data-label=”Ebook-Revolution”>ebook revolution</span>.</p>

<p>The <span id=”mention-75” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> <span id=”mention-227” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>, which was introduced in <span id=”mention-147” class=”mention-event” about=”2007” data-label=”2007”>2007</span>, effectively mainstreamed <span id=”mention-216” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span>. By 2010, it was clear that <span id=”mention-217” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> weren’t just a passing fad, but were here to stay. They appeared poised to disrupt the <span id=”mention-107” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishing industry</span> on a fundamental level. Analysts confidently predicted that millennials would <span id=”mention-262” class=”mention-opinion” about=”shift” data-label=”digital-shift”>embrace</span> <span id=”mention-218” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> with open arms and abandon <span id=”mention-153” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">print books</span>, that <span id=”mention-219” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> sales would keep rising to take up more and more market share, that the price of <span id=”mention-220” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> would continue to fall, and that <span id=”mention-108” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishing</span> would be <span id=”mention-263” class=”mention-opinion” about=”shift” data-label=”digital-shift”>forever changed</span>.</p>

<p>Instead, at the other end of the decade, <span id=”mention-221” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> sales seem to have stabilized at around 20 percent of total book sales, with <span id=”mention-154” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">print</span> sales making up the remaining 80 percent. <q>“Five or 10 years ago,” says <span id=”mention-1” class=”mention-person” about=”AndrewAlbanese” data-label=”Andrew-Albanese”>Andrew Albanese</span>, a senior writer at trade magazine  <span id=”mention-120” class=”mention-organisation” about=”PublisherWeekly” data-label=”Publisher-Weekly”>Publishers Weekly</span> and the author of The Battle of $9.99, “you would have thought those numbers would have been reversed.”</q></p>

<p>And in part, <span id=”mention-2” class=”mention-person” about=”AndrewAlbanese” data-label=”Andrew-Albanese”>Albanese</span> tells Vox in a phone interview, that’s because the <span id=”mention-6” class=”mention-person” about=”digitalNatives” data-label=”Digital-Natives”>digital natives of Gen Z and the millennial generation</span> have very little interest in buying <span id=”mention-222” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span>. <q>“They’re glued to their phones, they love social media, but when it comes to reading a book, they want John Green in <span id=”mention-155” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">print</span>,”</q> he says. The people who are actually buying <span id=”mention-223” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span>? Mostly <span id=”mention-7” class=”mention-person” about=”boomers” data-label=”boomers”>boomers</span>. <q>“<span id=”mention-8” class=”mention-person” about=”boomers” data-label=”boomers”>Older readers</span> are glued to their e-readers,”</q> says <span id=”mention-5” class=”mention-person” about=”AndrewAlbanese” data-label=”Andrew-Albanese”>Albanese</span>. <q>“They don’t have to go to the bookstore. They can <span id=”mention-256” class=”mention-opinion” about=”comfort” data-label=”comfort”>make the font bigger</span>. It’s convenient.”</q></p>

<p><span id=”mention-224” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">Ebooks</span> aren’t only selling less than everyone predicted they would at the beginning of the decade. They also cost more than everyone predicted they would — and consistently, they cost more than their <span id=”mention-156” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">print equivalents</span>. On <span id=”mention-35” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> as I’m writing this, a copy of Sally Rooney’s Normal People costs $12.99 as an <span id=”mention-170” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span>, but only $11.48 as a <span id=”mention-163” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover</span>. And increasingly, such disparities aren’t an exception. They’re the rule.</p>

<p>So what happened? How did the apparently inevitable <span id=”mention-151” class=”mention-event” about=”EbookRevolution” data-label=”Ebook-Revolution”>ebook revolution</span> fail to come to pass?</p>

<p>To figure out the answers, we’ll have to dive in deep to a lawsuit filed by the <span id=”mention-26” class=”mention-organisation” about=”DepartmentOfJustice” data-label=”Department-of-justice”>Department of Justice</span> in <span id=”mention-149” class=”mention-event” about=”2012” data-label=”2012”>2012</span> against  <span id=”mention-121” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> — newly entered into the <span id=”mention-171” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> market with the advent of the <span id=”mention-231” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad wiki-data-id="Q2796"”>iPad</span> — and five of what was then <span id=”mention-109” class=”mention-organisation” about=”BigSixPublishingHouses” data-label=”Big-Six-Publishing-Houses”>the Big Six publishing houses</span>. The <span id=”mention-27” class=”mention-organisation” about=”DepartmentOfJustice” data-label=”Department-of-justice”>Department of Justice</span> accused <span id=”mention-122” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> and the <span id=”mention-76” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> of colluding to fix ebook prices against <span id=”mention-34” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>, and although the <span id=”mention-32” class=”mention-organisation” about=”DepartmentOfJustice” data-label=”Department-of-justice”>DOJ </span> won its case in court, the pricing model that <span id=”mention-123” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> and the <span id=”mention-77” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> created together would continue to dominate the industry, creating unintended ripple effects</p>

<p>The case of US v. <span id=”mention-124” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> encapsulates the dysfunction of the last decade of publishing. It’s a story about what we’re willing to pay for books — and about an industry that is growing ever more consolidated, with fewer and fewer companies taking up more and more market share. What happened to the <span id=”mention-172” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> in the <span id=”mention-146” class=”mention-event” about=”2010s” data-label=”2010s”>2010s</span> is the story of the contraction of American publishing.</p>

<h2>“To my mind it’s game over for this business.”</h2>

<p>When the <span id=”mention-228” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> entered the marketplace in <span id=”mention-148” class=”mention-event” about=”2007” data-label=”2007”>2007</span>, <span id=”mention-36” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> had a simple sales pitch: Anyone with a <span id=”mention-229” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> could buy all the <span id=”mention-173” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> they wanted through the online marketplace, and many of those <span id=”mention-174” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> — in fact, all New York Times best-sellers — would cost no more than $9.99.</p>

<p>$9.99 is a steal for a new book. At the time, most <span id=”mention-164” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcovers</span> were averaging a list price of about $26, and many cost more. But for <span id=”mention-37” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>, this price point was an apparent no-brainer. The first generation <span id=”mention-230” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> was expensive, and value conscious customers needed some incentive to buy into it. Why would anyone spend $399 on an e-reader if they couldn’t expect to make up at least part of the cost in a discount on <span id=”mention-175” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span>?</p>

<p>And while this point is often glossed over, <span id=”mention-38” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> was actually following a precedent set by <span id=”mention-78” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> in its pricing model. In her opinion for US v. <span id=”mention-125” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span>, <span id=”mention-9” class=”mention-person” about=”JudgeDeniseCote” data-label=”Judge-Denise-Cote”>Judge Denise Cote</span> noted that before 2009, most <span id=”mention-79” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> discounted <span id=”mention-176” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> by 20 percent from the price of a <span id=”mention-165” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover</span>, which often led to a suggested list price of around $9.99.</p>

<p>But by 2009, <span id=”mention-80” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> had changed their minds. Now they considered the idea of $9.99 <span id=”mention-177” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> to be an existential threat. Printing and binding and shipping — the costs that <span id=”mention-178” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> eliminated — accounted for only two dollars of the cost of a <span id=”mention-166” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover</span>, <span id=”mention-81” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> argued. So the <span id=”mention-179” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> for a $20 <span id=”mention-167” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover book</span> should cost no less than $18. And according to <span id=”mention-82” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers, by setting the price of an <span id=”mention-180” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> at $9.99, <span id=”mention-39” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> was training readers to undervalue books.</p>

<p><blockquote>“The big concern — and it’s a massive concern — is the $9.99 pricing point,”</blockquote> David Young, the CEO of Hachette Book Group USA, told the New Yorker in 2010. <blockquote>“If it’s allowed to take hold in the consumer’s mind that a book is worth ten bucks, to my mind it’s game over for this business.”</blockquote></p>

<h2>Here’s where book prices come from</h2>

<p>Before we delve further into the weeds here, a quick primer on how book prices are set. <span id=”mention-157” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">Print books</span> are generally sold under a <span id=”mention-241” class=”mention-concept” about=”WholesaleModel” data-label=”Wholesale-Model”>wholesale model</span>, which works like this: First, the publisher will set a suggested list price for a book; say, $20. Then it will sell the book to resellers and distributors for a discount off that suggested list price. So if Simon & Schuster wants to sell a $20 book to <span id=”mention-40” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>, <span id=”mention-41” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> might negotiate a discount of 40 percent for itself and end up paying Simon & Schuster only $12 for that book.</p>

<p>But once <span id=”mention-42” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> owns the book, it has the right to set whatever price it would like for consumers. The $20 list price that Simon & Schuster set was just a suggestion. Under the <span id=”mention-242” class=”mention-concept” about=”WholesaleModel” data-label=”Wholesale-Model”>wholesale model</span>, <span id=”mention-43” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> is free to decide to sell the book to readers for as little as a single dollar if it chooses to.</p>

<p>Until 2010, <span id=”mention-181” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> were sold through the <span id=”mention-243” class=”mention-concept” about=”WholesaleModel” data-label=”Wholesale-Model”>wholesale model</span> too. So if Simon & Schuster was publishing a $20 <span id=”mention-168” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover</span>, they could choose to set a suggested list price of $18 for the <span id=”mention-182” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> — two dollars less than the <span id=”mention-169” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">hardcover</span> — and then sell that <span id=”mention-183” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> to <span id=”mention-44” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> at a 40 percent discount for $10.80. And <span id=”mention-45” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> could, in turn, feel free to sell that <span id=”mention-184” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> for $9.99 and swallow a loss of 81 cents.</p>

<p>To be clear, the numbers we’re using here to get a handle on how pricing works are imaginary. (<span id=”mention-46” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> negotiates different discounts for itself at different times from different <span id=”mention-83” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span>, sometimes around 40 percent, but at other times higher and at other times lower.) But we do know that <span id=”mention-47” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> was making very, very little money off <span id=”mention-185” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> sales in 2010, and was in fact probably losing money on most of them.</p>

<p>For a company as big as <span id=”mention-48” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>, it’s perfectly reasonable to lose money on a new initiative if that will help them dominate the market space. But <span id=”mention-84” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> were terrified of what would happen once <span id=”mention-49” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> had established itself as the only game in town, <span id=”mention-186” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook-wise</span>.</p>

<p>Would <span id=”mention-50” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> keep pushing prices ever further down? And once <span id=”mention-85” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> had nowhere else to sell their <span id=”mention-187” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span>, would <span id=”mention-51” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> start demanding lower and lower discounts from them to subsidize those low prices? Would <span id=”mention-52” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> start to demand that <span id=”mention-86” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> sell them <span id=”mention-188” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> for $5 so that it could maintain that customer-facing $9.99 price point but now make a profit?</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this tense and paranoid atmosphere that <span id=”mention-126” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> made its entrée into the <span id=”mention-189” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> market.</p>

<h2><span id=”mention-87” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>Publishers</span> hoped that <span id=”mention-238” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad”  wiki-data-id="Q2796">iBooks</span> would do for books what iTunes did for music. It didn’t quite work out that way.</h2>

<p>In 2010, <span id=”mention-142” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> launched the <span id=”mention-232” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iPad</span>, and with it, the modern tablet computer. And part of what made the <span id=”mention-233” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iPad</span> so exciting was that it contained <span id=”mention-234” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iBooks</span>, an app that <span id=”mention-88” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> were hoping would do for <span id=”mention-190” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> what iTunes had done for music: be so convenient and easy to use that consumers would flock to it rather than turn to piracy. Crucially, <span id=”mention-89” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> hoped that <span id=”mention-235” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iBooks</span> would be so streamlined and sleek that it could undermine <span id=”mention-53” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>’s book-selling dominance.</p>

<p><span id=”mention-127” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> was offering <span id=”mention-90” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> an incentive to root for it over <span id=”mention-54” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>. With its App Store, <span id=”mention-128” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> had established a resale model that worked differently from the <span id=”mention-239” class=”mention-concept” about=”WholesaleModel” data-label=”Wholesale-Model”>wholesale model</span> <span id=”mention-91” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> were used to. It was called the <span id=”mention-244” class=”mention-concept” about=”AgencyModel” data-label=”Agency-Model”>agency model</span>, and it worked like this: <span id=”mention-92” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> would decide on what the list price for their book should be, and then put it up for sale at that price in the <span id=”mention-236” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iBooks</span> store. <span id=”mention-129” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> would take a 30 percent commission on every sale.</p>

<p><span id=”mention-130” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> wasn’t willing to sell <span id=”mention-191” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> for $18, but it thought a cap of $14.99 was perfectly reasonable. And if <span id=”mention-93” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> decided to go along with <span id=”mention-131” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span>’s plan, they could set a list price of $14.99 for an <span id=”mention-192” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> and be sure that no one in the <span id=”mention-237” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iBooks</span> store would ever discount it without the <span id=”mention-94” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publisher</span>’s express permission. <span id=”mention-132” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span>, meanwhile, would pocket $4.50 from each sale.</p>

<p>But <span id=”mention-133” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span> couldn’t enter the <span id=”mention-193” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebook</span> market while charging consumers five dollars more per unit than its biggest competitor was. It needed some assurance that no one would have a cheaper product than it had. So it made a deal with five of <span id=”mention-110” class=”mention-organisation” about=”BigSixPublishingHouses” data-label=”Big-Six-Publishing-Houses”>the Big Six publishers</span> (Simon & Schuster, Penguin, HarperCollins, Hachette, and Macmillan; Random House, then the biggest trade publishing house, abstained): They could all sign on to <span id=”mention-134” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span>’s <span id=”mention-245” class=”mention-concept” about=”AgencyModel” data-label=”Agency-Model”>agency model</span>, as long as they guaranteed that they’d also use that same <span id=”mention-246” class=”mention-concept” about=”AgencyModel” data-label=”Agency-Model”>agency model</span> with every other retailer they worked with. That way, <span id=”mention-55” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span>, too, would be forced to sell its <span id=”mention-194” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> for $14.99 — and if it refused, <span id=”mention-95” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span> could withhold their <span id=”mention-195” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">ebooks</span> from <span id=”mention-56” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> and make them exclusive to <span id=”mention-135” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Apple” data-label=”Apple”>Apple</span>.</p>

<p><span id=”mention-96” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>Publishers</span> agreed to the deal. And just like that, everything changed.</p>

</p><p>
But while <span id=”mention-11” class=”mention-person” about=”JudgeDeniseCote” data-label=”Judge-Denise-Cote”>Cote</span>’s sanctions required <span id=”mention-118” class=”mention-organisation” about=”BigSixPublishingHouses” data-label=”Big-Six-Publishing-Houses”>publishers</span> to briefly modify the <span id=”mention-248” class=”mention-concept” about=”AgencyModel” data-label=”Agency-Model”>agency model</span> so that resellers could set their own prices, within a few years, those sanctions expired.

Ingram is a distributor, and it’s one of the only companies that currently exists to handle book distribution: It’s the <span id=”mention-71” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> or the Penguin Random House of this portion of the process of putting books out into the world.

Ingram benefits from an industry that has consolidated to the point that there is almost no competition, and entering the marketplace as a new and independent player is nearly impossible, along every single level.
