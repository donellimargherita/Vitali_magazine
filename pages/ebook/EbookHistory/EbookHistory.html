<h2>Today in Tedium:</h2> From a historic perspective, one of the most intriguing things about technology is the way that so-called “category killers” often make us forget about what came before. There are all sorts of examples of this, including the one I wrote about just the other night. The <span id=”mention-160” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad”  wiki-data-id="Q2796">iPad</span>, case in point, somehow made everyone forget about decades of formative digital tablets in one fell swoop. Another example is the <span id=”mention-115” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> <span id=”mention-73” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>, a decade-old device that successfully created a formative industry around <span id=”mention-27” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic books</span>. The truth is that it took a long time for <span id=”mention-23” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBooks</span> to “arrive”; <span id=”mention-116” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> was far from first. There, admittedly, was a <span id=”mention-118” class=”mention-opinion” about=”comfort” data-label=”comfort”>comfort level</span> that had to be worked out with the <span id=”mention-28” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span>, which gave <span id=”mention-117” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> the perfect opportunity to swoop in. Tonight’s Tedium talks about the evolution of <span id=”mention-30” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic books</span> before the <span id=”mention-74” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>. I’d tell you to turn the page, but we’re not really working with paper here, are we? — Ernie @ Tedium

He peruses with glassy stare: so much iron-hard information to be ingested quickly and assimilated thoroughly, then sent away deftly to electronic limbo.

<h2><span id=”mention-126” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>The Spanish teacher</span> who landed upon the <span id=”mention-25” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span>’s most important ideas in the 1940s</h2>
</p><p>
One thing that’s particularly fascinating to consider is that the <span id=”mention-33” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span> may actually predate any sort of consumer computing device whatsoever—and that it might have come from the world of education, not technology.
</p><p>
Certainly, <span id=”mention-99” class=”mention-concept” about=”Enciclopedia Mecánica” data-label=”Enciclopedia-Mecánica”>the machine Spanish teacher <span id=”mention-124” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>Ángela Ruiz Robles</span> came up with</span> in 1949 doesn’t look like what we would consider an <span id=”mention-34” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span>today—it was a machine, really, with visible spindles and information that scrolled horizontally. It included a place for a light source, along with zooming capabilities. (Here’s the patent, in Spanish, if you’re curious.)
</p>

<p>
But it served many of the same goals that the <span id=”mention-75” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> and other <span id=”mention-26” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> devices do now. It was designed for children who would otherwise have to carry around massive books to keep learning at home. Instead, the <span id=”mention-95” class=”mention-concept” about=”Enciclopedia Mecánica” data-label=”Enciclopedia-Mecánica”>Enciclopedia Mecánica</span> (Mechanical Encyclopedia) allowed large books to be replaced with small, efficient coils—not too dissimilar from rolls of film in size, but with illustrations and writings <span id=”mention-1” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">printed</span> on them. Students scrolled through the book by pressing one of the buttons on the device. Certainly, it didn’t look like a book, but this design was intended to please <span id=”mention-159” class=”mention-organisation” about=”publishingIndustry” data-label=”Publishing-Industry”>publishers</span>, as it meant they would be able to <span id=”mention-2” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book wiki-data-id="Q11396303"”>print</span> their books on giant scrolls, cutting down the cost of <span id=”mention-3” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303" >printing</span> a book significantly.
</p><p>
It was a brilliant idea, but one that unfortunately did not find the financial support in its day to gain broad distribution—in fact, just a single prototype was created. And it eventually faded from view.
</p><p>
<blockquote>“There were other priorities in the country and they went for other projects. Furthermore, the implementation of all the specifications of the invention was impractical,”</blockquote> University of Granada researcher María José Rodríguez Fortiz said of the invention, according to the New York Daily News. <blockquote>“In her later years <span id=”mention-127” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>Ángela</span> tried to resurrect the project, when everything was technologically viable. But she did not manage to secure public or private funding.”</blockquote>
</p><p>
But in an era when women inventors have been pulled out of the darkness and into the spotlight, <span id=”mention-129” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>Robles</span>’ story has, thankfully, found new currency. In 2016, <span id=”mention-130” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>she</span> was the subject of a Google Doodle in Spain and Mexico, and earlier this year, a street in Madrid was named after her.
</p>
<p>Her situation introduces many what-ifs to the story of the <span id=”mention-35” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span>, a tale that generally has leaned heavily on well-known innovators like Douglas Englebart and Alan Kay—definitely prominent figures who had a direct influence on all sorts of devices that we use now, but, in this specific case, not necessarily first.
</p><p>
<span id=”mention-128” class=”mention-person” about=”ÁngelaRuizRobles” data-label=”Ángela-Ruiz-Robles”>Robles</span> came to her solution not from a position of world shaking futurism, but practicality, and her device reflects real-world use cases.
</p><p>
Sure, it didn’t use <span id=”mention-43” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span> or flash memory, but at a time when our computers used drum memory, it was a stunning idea.

The amount of money, in computing time, that <span id=”mention-131” class=”mention-person” about=”MichealHart” data-label=”Micheal-Hart”> Michael Hart </span>, the creator of the <span id=”mention-141” class=”mention-organisation” about=”ProjectGutenberg” data-label=”Project-Gutenberg”>Project Gutenberg</span> initiative, received in 1971 while a student at the University of Illinois—basically receiving that generous amount of computing access because he knew a guy. He decided to use that basically unlimited amount of computing time to create a project to store large amounts of literature in digital forms—effectively leading to the creation of the largest store of digital information for public consumption in the years before cloud computing, and decades before most <span id=”mention-57” class=”mention-concept” about=”library” data-label=”library” wiki-data-id="Q7075">libraries</span> themselves went digital. <span id=”mention-132” class=”mention-person” about=”MichealHart” data-label=”Micheal-Hart”>Hart</span> and other volunteers were literally typing in entire books by hand, in an impressive show of crowdsourcing. <span id=”mention-142” class=”mention-organisation” about=”ProjectGutenberg” data-label=”Project-Gutenberg”>The project</span>, still active today, is one of the most prominent examples of the public domain in action, the concept outliving <span id=”mention-133” class=”mention-person” about=”MichealHart” data-label=”Micheal-Hart”>Hart himself</span>, who died in 2011.

</h2><p>
There was once a time when the vanguard of <span id=”mention-37” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic books </span> was closer in design to a graphing calculator than a book.
</p><p>
The <span id=”mention-89” class=”mention-concept” about=”data discman” data-label=”data-discman”>Data Discman</span>, <span id=”mention-109” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span>’s CD-based early entry into the realm of <span id=”mention-38” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic books</span>, didn’t look like a Walkman, despite the name, and it wasn’t exactly a world-changer, in no small part due to its limitations.
</p><p>
Chunky in size, the system had a small, monochrome LCD display that was hard to read; the machine used nonstandard CDs that looked like the better-known MiniDiscs but were simply miniature CDs; and it used a proprietary authoring system, ensuring the size of the <span id=”mention-58” class=”mention-concept” about=”library” data-label=”library” wiki-data-id="Q7075">library</span> would be limited. Oh yeah—when it was released, it cost more than $400.
</p><p>
Despite all that, it was a modest hit in <span id=”mention-139” class=”mention-place” about=”Japan” data-label=”Japan”>Japan</span>, selling between 70,000 and 100,000 units in its first year, according to The New York Times. A later device called the <span id=”mention-104” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span> Bookman accepted full-sized discs and was compatible with DOS, but cost even more. The result? Failure.

The device gained a reputation as being very holdable, but the screen was an issue, however. <blockquote>“The <span id=”mention-9” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> is pleasant to read for a half-hour at most,” a PC Magazine review explained, adding, “your eyes will start complaining if you use it for longer periods.”</blockquote> Notably, <span id=”mention-136” class=”mention-person” about=”MartinEberhardandMarcTarpenning” data-label=”Martin-Eberhard-and-Marc-Tarpenning”>Eberhard and Tarpenning</span> later founded another company that created a device that further highlighted this improvement in battery life: Tesla Motors.

<h3>Franklin Bookman:</h3> As I wrote about a while back, Franklin Electronics had carved out an important niche for itself as a maker of electronic devices that were <span id=”mention-158” class=”mention-opinion” about=”economicadvantage” data-label=”economic-advantage”>cheap</span> and <span id=”mention-155” class=”mention-opinion” about=”comfort” data-label=”comfort”>easy to use</span>. In the mid-’90s, the company started marketing these devices as <span id=”mention-39” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">“electronic books,”</span> though they clearly weren’t intended for novels. The Franklin Bookman, released in 1995 and sold for $130, wasn’t going to compete with the latest Tom Clancy novel, but its cartridge-based system for reference books was an important evolution in the <span id=”mention-10” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> model, and one that was closer to what people needed than the <span id=”mention-90” class=”mention-concept” about=”data discman” data-label=”data-discman”>Data Discman</span>.

<h3>SoftBook Reader:</h3> Released around the same time as the Rocket <span id=”mention-11” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span>, the device was something of a mix between an <span id=”mention-160” class=”mention-concept” about=”iPad” data-label=”iPad” wiki-data-id="Q2796">iPad</span> and a Palm Pilot, and had quite a bit of heft—it weighed nearly three pounds, more than twice the weight of its primary competition at the time. Despite paling in comparison to the competition, it deserves notice here for two reasons: One, it was financially backed by Random House and Simon & Schuster; and two, it was a HTML-based device, meaning its internals were fairly unique for the time. Its fate was tied to the Rocket <span id=”mention-12” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> in another important way: In 2000, Gemstar, the maker of the VCR Plus+ and the then-owner of TV Guide, acquired both of their parent companies at the same time

<h3><span id=”mention-105” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span> Librie:</h3> Despite its failure with the <span id=”mention-91” class=”mention-concept” about=”data discman” data-label=”data-discman”>Data Discman</span>, <span id=”mention-106” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span> deserves special mention here, in that it released the first <span id=”mention-44” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span>-based <span id=”mention-40” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span> in Japan back in 2004. This device, with a 600x800-resolution display, was able to get a lot of mileage out of four AAA batteries—10,000 pages, to be exact—and its design was actually fairly close to that of the original <span id=”mention-78” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>. But as with many things that <span id=”mention-107” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span> created during this era, its proprietary technology—specifically, the use of the Memory Stick and its internal DRM technology—did not help encourage broad uptake. Despite literally creating the first device in a notable market, <span id=”mention-108” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Sony” data-label=”Sony”>Sony</span> stopped selling <span id=”mention-13” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBooks</span>five years ago.

The evolution and modern limitations of <span id=”mention-60” class=”mention-concept” about=”electronic paper” data-label=”electronic-paper”>electronic paper</span>

The secret sauce of the modern <span id=”mention-15” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> is <span id=”mention-54” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>digital ink</span>, the display technology meant to make reading crisp and <span id=”mention-158” class=”mention-opinion” about=”comfort” data-label=”comfort”>easy on the eyes</span>. And like the <span id=”mention-16” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> itself, it took a few tries to get <span id=”mention-61” class=”mention-concept” about=”electronic paper” data-label=”electronic-paper”>electronic paper</span> right.
</p><p>
The concept of came to life in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the same technology lab that brought us the graphical user interface and the laser <span id=”mention-4” class=”mention-concept” about=”printer” data-label=”printer”>printer</span>—but the use case wouldn’t be clear to the tinkerers at Xerox PARC for decades.
</p><p>
The needs of one of Xerox’s most fundamental ideas, the Alto computer, inspired the creation of <span id=”mention-145” class=”mention-concept” about=”Gyricon” data-label=”Gyricon”>Gyricon</span>, the first <span id=”mention-62” class=”mention-concept” about=”electronic paper” data-label=”electronic-paper”>electronic paper</span> technology. This material, which was developed after it was decided that the Alto’s monitor wasn’t bright enough, relied on the use of a set of tiny rotating beads that flipped sides with electric charges. The concept was the more promising of two display technologies worked on at the time, but it sat on the shelf for decades without a clear use, and with a corporate parent that showed little interest in anything but <span id=”mention-5” class=”mention-concept” about=”printer” data-label=”printer”>printers</span> and copiers.
</p><p>
In an interview with The Future of Things, the technology’s inventor, <span id=”mention-135” class=”mention-person” about=”NickSheridon” data-label=”Nick-Sheridon”>Nick Sheridon</span>, explained that he only figured out that there might be a market for a paper-like display technology in 1989, nearly 20 years after <span id=”mention-146” class=”mention-concept” about=”Gyricon” data-label=”Gyricon”>Gyricon</span> technology was first created.

<blockquote>“I realized that most of the paper consumption was caused by a difference in <span id=”mention-119” class=”mention-opinion” about=”comfort” data-label=”comfort”>comfort level</span> between reading documents on paper and reading them on the CRT screen,” he told the outlet. “Any document over a half page in length was likely to be <span id=”mention-6” class=”mention-concept” about=”printed book” data-label=”printed-book” wiki-data-id="Q11396303">printed</span>, subsequently read, and discarded within a day.”</blockquote>
</p><p>
He was correct that there was room for a paper-like display, but while <span id=”mention-147” class=”mention-concept” about=”Gyricon” data-label=”Gyricon”>Gyricon</span> got a lot of attention from Xerox in the ’90s and early 2000s, it was a competing idea that eventually became the norm for many <span id=”mention-17” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span><span id=”mention-84” class=”mention-concept” about=”e-reader” data-label=”electronic-reader”> readers</span>.
</p><p>
The idea for <span id=”mention-45” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span> didn’t come from Xerox; it came from <span id=”mention-140” class=”mention-organisation” about=”MIT” data-label=”MIT”>MIT</span> — specifically, students who had initially (and unknowingly) considered a solution very similar to <span id=”mention-148” class=”mention-concept” about=”Gyricon” data-label=”Gyricon”>Gyricon</span>. But <span id=”mention-137” class=”mention-person” about=”J.D.Albert” data-label=”J.D.-Albert”>J.D. Albert</span>, one of the founders of <span id=”mention-46” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span>, ended up improving on the idea in part because he struggled to replicate the <span id=”mention-149” class=”mention-concept” about=”Gyricon” data-label=”Gyricon”>Gyricon</span> approach. According to a 2000 Wall Street Journal article, <span id=”mention-138” class=”mention-person” about=”J.D.Albert” data-label=”J.D.-Albert”>he</span> wanted to make particles that were half-white, half-black, but instead made some all-white ones. His classmate, Barrett Comiskey, later took those all-white balls, mixed in some dark dye and liquid, and used the phenomenon of <span id=”mention-151” class=”mention-concept” about=”electrophoresis” data-label=”electrophoresis”>electrophoresis</span>—effectively, using electric charges to affect the motion of particles within a fluid—to affect the display of particles on a screen.

The resulting “page” was high-contrast, easily readable, and didn’t require constant electricity like a computer screen did. Soon, it would be the foundation for <span id=”mention-47” class=”mention-organisation”” about=”eInkCompany” data-label=”eInk-company”>eInk</span>, the company. The technology took a while to gestate, but soon became good enough for <span id=”mention-79” class=”mention-concept” about=”e-reader” data-label=”electronic-reader”>e-reader</span>s like the <span id=”mention-64” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>.
</p><p>
Of course, color was a lot harder to pull off using the technology they had created than it’s been with comparable LCD technology, and as a result, it took years for <span id=”mention-48” class=”mention-organisation”” about=”eInkCompany” data-label=”eInk-company”>eInk</span> to develop a color screen that showed up in an <span id=”mention-80” class=”mention-concept” about=”e-reader” data-label=”electronic-reader”>eReader</span>. In fact, the company’s first try at it totally flopped. So did the competition’s. Color may be a “killer app” for <span id=”mention-55” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>digital ink</span> someday, but it needs to be good enough to properly reproduce those colors first.
</p><p>
However, we’re getting closer to a good-looking variation on color <span id=”mention-49” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span>. Three-color eInk panels are relatively easy to find, and the company has a technology called Advanced Color ePaper in the works, which it’s pushing for digital signage rather than <span id=”mention-18” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBooks</span> at the moment. A competitor, <span id=”mention-143” class=”mention-organisation”” about=”CLEARink” data-label=”CLEARink”>CLEARink</span>, is aiming more directly at bibliophiles.
</p><p>
Other display technologies have surfaced over the years to give <span id=”mention-56” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>digital ink</span> some competition—including “electrowetting,” another display technology Xerox PARC originally worked on in the 1970s, but none have managed to topple the approach taken by <span id=”mention-50” class=”mention-organisation”” about=”eInkCompany” data-label=”eInk-company”>eInk</span>—yet.
</p><p>
The <span id=”mention-66” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">electronic book</span> had a lot it was going against before the release of the <span id=”mention-65” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>. It still does, really.
</p><p>
In ways unlike any other format, the physical book—spine and all—has seen defenders repeatedly come out of the woodwork over the years, and numerous studies put out since the release of the <span id=”mention-67” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> have given fodder to <span id=”mention-19” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> <span id=”mention-153” class=”mention-opinion” about=”skepticism” data-label=”skepticism”>skeptics</span> who aren’t ready to give up trees just yet. Even in cases where the <span id=”mention-152” class=”mention-opinion” about=”economicadvantage” data-label=”economic-advantage”>economic advantages</span> seem obvious, like with college textbooks, the digital forms haven’t won out entirely yet.
</p><p>
Perhaps this <span id=”mention-154” class=”mention-opinion” about=”skepticism” data-label=”skepticism”>skepticism</span> has been a driving factor in the bounce-back of real books over digital ones—<span id=”mention-20” class=”mention-concept” about=”ebook” data-label=”ebook” wiki-data-id="Q128093">eBook</span> sales reportedly fell nearly 20 percent in 2016 and another 10 percent in 2017. But on the other hand, it’s simply hard to ignore the fact that there wasn’t really much of a market at all before <span id=”mention-51” class=”mention-concept” about=”eInk” data-label=”electronic-ink”>eInk</span>-based <span id=”mention-81” class=”mention-concept” about=”e-reader” data-label=”electronic-reader”>readers</span> finally came into their own, and importantly, <span id=”mention-113” class=”mention-organisation” about=”Amazon” data-label=”Amazon” wiki-data-id="Q3884">Amazon</span> (with the <span id=”mention-68” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span>) and Barnes & Noble (with the <span id=”mention-97” class=”mention-concept” about=”Nook” data-label=”BandN-Nook”>Nook</span>) created marketplaces that made digital content plentiful and easy to acquire.
</p><p>
When it comes down to it, it was that mixture of technology and content that proved so vital. Perhaps a <span id=”mention-69” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> or <span id=”mention-85” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kobo” data-label=”Kobo”>Kobo</span> never will feel exactly like a book, but it got close enough for a large number of readers that the difference stopped mattering.
</p><p>
Perhaps we’ll never be rid of the world’s oldest content format. Maybe the <span id=”mention-70” class=”mention-concept” about=”Kindle” data-label=”Kindle” wiki-data-id="Q136469">Kindle</span> is as close as we’ll get to digital books replacing physical copies. But it’s been an interesting read watching the tech world try.
