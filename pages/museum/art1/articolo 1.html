		<p>I regularly work with museums to improve their use of technology to open up</p>
		<p>their collections, attract more visitors and build better relationships and the</p>
		<p>discussion usually turns to the impact of technology on museum content. How</p>
		<p>can a museum’s online content contribute to the wider aims of the museum</p>
		<p>and how the online museum content can fit within the broader museum</p>
		<p>definition. We normally end up asking more questions than we answer. Can a </p>
		<p>museum ever be solely online? Can online content improve conservation</p>
		<p>efforts? Is a visit to an online museums ever an acceptable replacement for</p>
		<p>physical visit?</p>
		
		<p>When we get into the detail of the argument surrounding online museums</p>
		<p>there is always a lot of questions around what ‘really’ constitutes a museum.</p>
		<p>So to start we need to ask the biggest question of all – “how do you define a</p>
		<p>museum?” and, as you would expect, the more people you ask the more</p>
		<p>complex and diverse the answers.</p>

		<h2><p class="subtitle">Is an online museum really a museum?</p></h2>
		<p>For the<span id="mention-2" class="mention organisation" about="Collins" data-label="Collins">Collins dictionary</span>the definition is short and sweet “A museum is a</p>
		<p>building where a large number of interesting and valuable objects, such as</p>
		<p>works of art or historical items, are kept, studied, and displayed to the public.”</p>
		
		<p>Whereas the<span id="mention-3" class="mention organisation" about="UK Museums Association" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">UK Museums Association</span>take a slightly more precise view and</p>
		<p>defines a museum under these criteria “’Museums enable people to explore</p>
		<p>collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment. They are institutions that</p>
		<p>collect, safeguard and make accessible artefacts and specimens, which they</p>
		<p>hold in trust for society. This definition includes art galleries with collections of</p>
		<p>works of art, as well as museums with historical collections of objects.”</p>
		
		<p>You may think there isn’t much difference between the two definitions but</p>
		<p>there is one vital difference that, for me, gets to the heart of it. “A museum is a</p>
		<p>building” the dictionary proclaims but yet there are many institutions of</p>
		<p>learning, collections of artefacts and repositories of valuable and interesting</p>
		<p>objects that don’t require a physical space to define them. If we look at both</p>
		<p>definitions I am sure we can find numerous examples that fit the criteria but</p>
		<p>don’t demand a physical space.</p>
		
		<p>As the<span id="mention-4" class="mention organisation" about="UK Museums Association" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">UK Museums Association</span>says we are looking for “institutions that</p>
		<p>collect, safeguard and make accessible” and one thing that a physical building</p>
		<p>can sometimes limit is accessibility. An Online museum could actually improve</p>
		<p>access to the collections the museum is caring for, allowing people to find</p>
		<p>exhibitions that truly speak to them regardless of location and make links</p>
		<p>between artefacts held by museums and galleries on opposite sides of the</p>
		<p>world.</p>
		
		<p>So let’s put down aside our dictionary definition which requires a physical</p>
		<p>space and let’s look at what can be achieved if we are open to providing online</p>
		<p>museum content alongside our physical collections or in addition to the</p>
		<p>location-based services museums offer.</p>
		
		<h2><span class="subtitle">Could online museums help preserve our artefacts better?</span></h2>
		<p>The worlds most visited museum in<time datetime="2018">2018</time>was the<span id="mention-5" class="mention organisation" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q19675">Louvre</span>,<span id="mention-6" class="mention place" about="Paris" data-label="Paris" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Paris</span>which reported</p>
		<p>10.2 million visitors, a 25% increase from<time datetime="2017">2017</time>and the Physical space the</p>
		<p><span id="mention-7" class="mention organisation" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Louvre</span>inhabits is both a help and a hindrance. The<span id="mention-8" class="mention organisation" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Louvre</span>is housed in an</p>
		<p>iconic building, in the centre of one of<span id="mention-9" class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>'s most visited cities and was</p>
		<p>featured in a well-documented music video for<span id="mention-10" class="mention person" about="Beyoncé" data-label="Beyoncé" data-wikidata-id="Q36153">Beyoncé</span>and<span id="mention-11" class="mention person" about="Jay Z" data-label="Jay Z" data-wikidata-id="Q62766">Jay Z</span>'s single,</p>
		<p>Apeshit in which they use the physical space and collection as a backdrop for</p>
		<p>their contemporary dancers. The physical building contributes massively to its</p>
		<p>status as most visited museum and it’s hard to believe that an online museum</p>
		<p>might one day play host to a superstar who boosts their attendance by 25%</p>
		<p>year on year</p>

		<p>But this high growth in visitor volume may not be sustainable for many</p>
		<p>physical locations and, whilst many museums are yet to have an issue with too</p>
		<p>many visitors, there has been a lot of publicity in recent years surrounding high</p>
		<p>visitor numbers and locations closing to tourists altogether. These high volume</p>
		<p>tourist locations have been forced to change their ways of operating for the</p>
		<p>sake of the places and artefacts the space is meant to preserve and</p>
		<p>safeguard for future generations.</p>
		
		<p>In<time datetime="2018">2018</time>,<span id="mention-12" class="mention place" about="Machu Pichu" data-label="MachuPichu" data-wikidata-id="Q676203"> Machu Pichu</span>, a <span id="mention-13" class="mention organisation" about="UNESCO" data-label="UNESCO" data-wikidata-id="Q7809">Unesco</span> world heritage site in <span id="mention-14" class="mention place" about="Peru" data-label="Peru" data-wikidata-id="Q419"> brought in a 
		<p>timed ticketing system which it hoped would alleviate the destruction</p>
		<p>caused by un-controlled visitation levels sometimes twice the</p>
		<p>recommended <span id="mention-15" class="mention organisation" about="UNESCO" data-label="UNESCO" data-wikidata-id="Q7809">Unesco</span> limit for the historic site. Whilst its impact is still</p>
		<p>being monitored they are hoping the requirement for a timede ticket will</p>
		<p>reduce the wear and tear on the historic environment.</p>
		
		<p>For some of the world's most valuable objects the mere act of display can</p>
		<p>be too much for it to be considered ethical to display the item at all.</p>
		<p>Whether its light, humidity or temperature, controlling the environment for</p>
		<p>some historical artefacts is paramount and not always compatible with the</p>
		<p>desire to show it to the public.</p>
		
		<p>The <span id="mention 16" class="mention organisation" about="V&A" data-label="V&A" data-wikidata-id="Q213322">V&A</span>.<span id="mention-17" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> is home to the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-ardabil-carpet">Ardabil carpet</a> which is lit for only 10</p>
		<p>minutes of each hour to allow visitors to see it without destroying the</p>
		<p>carpets rich colours and fine textures. The inclusion of the carpet in the</p>
		<p>online museum collection allows for more time to explore the carpet in close</p>
		<p>proximity which would never be possible in real life. This limited light for</p>
		<p>physical visitors combined with its online presence means it can be</p>
		<p>preserved for future generations and still be enjoyed by visitors today.</p>
		
		<p>As the world's population continues to grow, wee may need to look to</p>
		<p>alternatives to travelling to one physical location to share our historical</p>
		<p>collections, artefacts and works of art. If an online museum can allow</p>
		<p>content to be shared across the world whilst keeping the original cared for</p>
		<p>in perfect conditions out of sight of the public what impact could that have</p>
		<p>on other museum activities?</p>
		
		<h2><p class="subtitle">Content for everyone, everywhere</p></h2>
		
		<p>According to the most recent statistics from Internet World Statistics in</p>
		<p><time datetime="April 2019">April 2019</time>, 56.1% of the world's population has internet access. Whilst</p>
		<p>some countries lag behind in internet connectivity or limit their residents</p>
		<p>access through censorship the amount of potential online museum visitors is</p>
		<p>still over 4.3 billion users.</p>
		
		<p>With the improvement in virtual reality we have seen in past few years</p>
		<p>it's not too far-fetched to think of a future where <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/article/bring-the-museum-to-the-classroom-with-virtual-reality-field-trips/">virtual schools trips</a> are</p>
		<p>taken by children wearing VR equipment in their classroom. where you</p>
		<p>could build you own <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/">virtual museum</a> and include your favourite artworks</p>
		<p>and artefacts from various collections in one place and feel like you are</p>
		<p>walking around the real, or imagined, museum in real time.</p>
		
		<p>But we don't need to even go that far to see how the online museum could</p>
		<p>bring content, learning and understanding to virtual visitors. Whether it be</p>
		<p>Facebook live events with live Q&A, virtual gallery tours hosted by</p>
		<p>exhibition curators or YouTube interviews with the artists themselves, there</p>
		<p>are hundreds of ways to connect your museum to your supporters with</p>
		<p>online content.</p>

		<p>In <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, the <span id="mention-18" class="mention organisation" about="National Museum of Australia" data-label="National Museum of Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q1967496"><a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/">National Museum of Australia</a> trialled a virtual museum tour</p>
		<p>which allowed online visitors to control a robot equipped with camera,</p>
		<p>speaker and microphone  and follow museum guides around the museum at</p>
		<p>their own pace. This new way of allowing remote visitors to interact with the</p>
		<p>museum online proved particularly popular with school children spread out</p>
		<p>all across Australia. These children, from as far away as a 4 hour flight</p>
		<p>across the country, could partake in a tour of their heritage and cultural</p>
		<p>artefacts without leaving their classroom. For these school children, who</p>
		<p>were unlikely to visit the physical museum, <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/article/making-museums-accessible-with-a-telepresence-robot/">using a robot to access the museum</a></p>
		<p>proved a big hit and allowed them to participate in a way that</p>
		<p>would seem incredible to previous generations.</p>
		
		<p>Even without the need of robots, hi-tech gadgets and specialist</p>
		<p>equipment museums can turn their physical collections into online</p>
		<p>content with fantastic results. <span id="mention-19" class="mention person" about="NicholasCullinan" data-label="Nicholas Cullinan" data-wikidata-id="Q18753268">Nicholas Cullinan</span>, director of the</p>
		<p><span id="mention-20" class="mention organisation" about="National Portrait Gallery" data-label="National Portrait Gallery" data-wikidata-id="Q238587">National Portrait Gallery</span> in <span id="mention-21" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> told the Art Newspaper that</p>
		<p>visitor numbers to a museum's physical location were only part of</p>
		<p>the picture when interpreting the impact of a museum on its</p>
		<p>visitors. <span id="mention-22" class="mention person" about="NicholasCullinan" data-label="Nicholas Cullinan" data-wikidata-id="Q18753268">Nicholas</span> shared that "Half of our 1.2 million followers on</p>
		<p>social media and 42% of our five million annual web visits</p>
		<p>originate from outside the <span id="mention-23" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">UK</span>; these aree people who are unlikely</p>
		<p>to make a visit but are able to engage with the content we share.</p>
		<p>(A recent <span id="mention-24" class="mention organisation" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook" data-wikidata-id="Q355">Facebook</span> Live broadcast from our <span id="mention-25" class="mention person" about="ThomasGainsborough" data-label="Thomas Gainsborough" data-wikidata-id="Q192720">Gainsborough</span></p>
		<p>exhibition had 30,000 views, giving many more people access to</p>
		<p>curatorial expertise than could ever attend a tour in person.)"</p>
		
		<p>When <span id="mention-26" class="mention organisation" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook" data-wikidata-id="Q355">Facebook</span> and other social media platforms make it so</p>
		<p>easy to share content for your online museum you don't need to</p>
		<p>invest in too much new technology but can turn your attention to</p>
		<p>making the content you share as important as your physical</p>
		<p>collections. Again if we go back to our "what is a museum?"</p>
		<p>definition we may feel the purpose of our museum overall may be</p>
		<p>better met by taking our collections, art and artefacts to where</p>
		<p>the people are. The message is overwhelming, the people are</p>
		<p>increasingly online and if you want to reach them you may also</p>
		<p>need to work on the collections for your online museum. To allow</p>
		<p>people to access, study and make the most of your artefacts you</p>
		<p>have a duty to share those items with as many people as you can</p>
		<p>whether they can visit your physical location or not.</p>
		
		<h2><p class="subtitle">Could a museum be fully online?</p></h2>
		<p>It may surprise you to know that there are a number of resources</p>
		<p>online that consider themselves museums and have similar</p>
		<p>missions to, what most people would consider, a museum. And</p>
		<p>most importantly they definitely fit our definition put forward by</p>
		<p>the <span id="mention-27" class="mention organisation" about="UK Museums Association" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">Museums Association</span> earlier.</p>
		
		<p>Based in <span id="mention-28" class="mention place" about="Arizona" data-label="Arizona" data-wikidata-id="Q816">Arizona</span> the <span id="mention-29" class="mention organisation" about="Tucson LGBTQ Museum" data-label="Tucson LGBTQ Museum" data-wikidata-id="Q15961611""><a href="https://tucsongaymuseum.org/">Tucson LGBTQ Museum</a></span> is an online-only museum. Whilst</p>
		<p>it might not be the most technologically advanced online resource, the museum has</p>
		<p>been collecting, curating and caring for LGBTQ objects and artefacts since <time datetime="1967">1967</time></p>
		<p>and today showcases the history of the LGBTQ movement and provides an online</p>
		<p>space to collate ideas, host exhibitions and provide historical content for research</p>
		<p>students. If we are looking for a community space where important artefacts are</p>
		<p>kept, cared for and displayed then this definitely fits the bill without requiring a</p>
		<p>building.</p>
		
		<p>For a more technologically advanced online museum we can look to the <span id="mention-30" class="mention organisation" about="Internet Museum Sweden" data-label="Internet Museum Sweden"><a href="https://www.internetmuseum.se/">Internet Museum, Sweden</a></span></p>
		<p>which opened in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>. Designed to celebrate and document the</p>
		<p>Swedish history of the internet, this completely online resource aims to make the</p>
		<p>internet a better place whilst curating internet specific historical items and</p>
		<p>preserving <span id="mention-31" class="mention place" about="Sweden" data-label="Sweden" data-wikidata-id="Q34">Sweden</span>'s digital heritage. This museum obviously sees itself as a vital</p>
		<p>resource for our increasingly virtual world and, as it charts the history of probably</p>
		<p>the single biggest change to the way we live, I can all but guarantee it will become</p>
		<p>more important as time goes on.</p>
		
		<p>There are also some museums where the physical building was unable to continue</p>
		<p>but the content was still historically important to the community the museum</p>
		<p>served. The physical <span id="mention-32" class="mention organisation" about="St. George's Museum'" data-label="St. George's Museum">St. George's Museum</span> closed in the <time datetime="1950">1950</time>'s with <span id="mention-33" class="mention person" about="JohnRuskin" data-label="John Ruskin" data-wikidata-id="Q179126">John Ruskin</span>'s</p>
		<p>collection being removed into various other museum collections or into storage. With</p>
		<p>the hope of reinstating this collection into a single location, the online museum was</p>
		<p>created to showcase the original museum’s collection, its contents and historical</p>
		<p>importance. The online museum project continues the work of its original founder to</p>
		<p>showcase the collection through images of the physical museum as it was originally</p>
		<p>curated.</p>
		
		<p>I would like to think that with the advances in technology museums would see an</p>
		<p>increase in online visitation and, at some point, be able to put in as much effort into</p>
		<p>their virtual content as they do in to the physical buildings and displays. With the</p>
		<p>promise of more potential visitors, contributors and supporters for the museum this</p>
		<p>makes sense but it also gives you unlimited space to curate, create and educate</p>
		<p>without constraints on visitor volume, accessibility of your building and care</p>
		<p>considerations for your more delicate items.</p>
		
		<p>If you can imagine that in the near future you could virtually visit any online museum</p>
		<p>from the comfort of your own home, store your favourite items in your own personal</p>
		<p>online museum collection or take a curator led tour with friends from across the</p>
		<p>world, we think you’ll agree that the online museum is soon to be a vital part of the</p>
		<p>museum eco-system.</p>
