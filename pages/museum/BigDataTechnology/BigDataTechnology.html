		<h2><b><p class="subtitle">1.Introduction</p></b></h2>
		<p>Museums [1] are the main platform for displaying national cultural heritage [2] and history. Each 
		country has its own unique historical heritage and cultural background [3, 4]. With the rapid 
		development of economic construction [5, 6], <span id="mention-14" class="mention place" about="China" data-label="China" data-wikidata-id="Q148">China</span> pays more attention to the inheritance of history
		and culture. In the new century, with the rapid development of science and technology, a large number 
		of industries use the Internet. Many industries have obtained good development opportunities by using 
		<span id="mention-15" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span>technology, and museums are no exception.
		
		<span id="mention-16" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">Big data</span> [7] is not a new technology. This technology has four characteristics: first, as the name 	
		implies, it has a huge amount of data, ranging from TB to Pb; second, <span id="mention-17" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> technology requires many 
		types of data, including audio, video, logs, pictures, geographic location information, etc. Third, the 
		authenticity of data, the accuracy and authenticity of data sources [8, 9] will directly lead to the 
		correctness of the analysis results. If the data source is complete and true, the final analysis results and 
		decisions will be more accurate.
		
		This paper studies the application of <span id="mention-18" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span>technology in Digital Museum exhibition [10]. Through 
		the questionnaire, it can be seen that after the application of <span id="mention-19" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> technology, the staff of the museum 
		can carry out the cultural relics exhibition work in the museum more efficiently, and the visitors to the 
		museum can also get a better viewing experience and better feel the history and culture in the digital 
		exhibition supported by <span id="mention-20" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span>.</p>
		
		<h2><b><p class="subtitle">2. Digital Museum and Application of <span id="mention-21" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">Big Data</span> Technology</p></b></h2>
		<h3><i><p class="byline">2.1 Digital Exhibition of Museums</p></i></h3>
		<p>The main purpose of Museum exhibition activities is to let the public understand the relevant
		information of cultural relics collection, carry out reasonable, safe, purposeful and planned design, and 
		implement comprehensive projects in art, sound, color, visual image and space environment. Exhibition 
		has a high demand for technical means, which requires exhibition design to reflect the characteristics of 
		human biochemistry. With the advent of the information age, digital technology has penetrated into all 
		aspects of people's life. Digital technology is also widely used in museum exhibitions to show culture 
		to visitors in digital form. The exhibition activities of museums will develop in the direction of 
		integration, networking and digitization.
		
		The application of digital technology is based on the basic conditions of computer. The information 
		and images of the exhibits are digitized by computer. In the process of visiting the museum, the public 
		has strong autonomy and can freely choose the contents and routes to visit. The digital display can 
		directly display the information about the exhibits. To some extent, product display breaks through the 
		limitation of space conditions, and is an extension of traditional display mode. It not only reduces the 
		damage to cultural relics collection, but also fully demonstrates the essence of cultural relics collection.</p>
		
		<h3><i><p class="byline">2.2 Application of Big Data in Digital Museum</p></i></h3>
		<p><span id="mention-22" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">"Big data""</span>refers to very large-scale data, which cannot be collected, processed, stored, analyzed and		
		managed by traditional data tools. The volume and types of such data are very large. <span id="mention-23" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">Big data</span> of
		museums mainly includes collection data and audience data. From the functional level, museum data 
		can be divided into four categories: collection related data with collection as the core; management data 
		generated by museum internal business work; communication data composed of cultural communication, 
		educational activities, digital communication tools and their feedback mechanism; online and offline
		user behavior data generated in the process of providing services for the audience. Only by making 
		rational use of <span id="mention-24" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> technology can we take data as a good helper in museum management and use  
		data to promote the organization of various activities in museums.</p>
		
		<h2><b><p class="subtitle">3. Experimental Correlation Analysis</p></b></h2>
		<h3><i><p class="byline">3.1 Experimental Background</p></i></h3>
		<p>The progress of computer and communication industry is obvious. The innovation, management, 
		dissemination and statistical technology of digital resources have also been improved accordingly, and 
		digital museum has emerged as the times require.
		<span id="mention-25" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">Big data</span>is now being hotly discussed by all sectors of society. With the advent of the Internet era, a 
		variety of intelligent terminal devices have been widely used. The Internet, microblog, WeChat and 
		other social media, monitoring devices and various sensors produce a large amount of data all the time. 
		Whenever people share information on the Internet, open different applications, or browse any web page, 
		they collect data into the ocean of <span id="mention-26" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span>. The arrival of <span id="mention-27" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> era is a rare opportunity for museums. 
		We should seize the opportunity to change the old ideas and bring new development to the museum.</p>
		
		<h3><i><p class="byline">3.2 Experimental design</p></i></h3>
		<p>In this paper, the Museum of big data technology is studied. The museum has been operating on <span id="mention-28" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> 
		technology for a month. Starting from the month before the museum applied 
		<span id="mention-29" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> technology to
		carry out digital exhibition work, this paper takes a week as a time period to count the flow of people in 
		the museum before and after the application of the technology, so as to get the impact of the technology 
		on the operation of the museum. The experimental results are shown in Table 1.</p>

		assist their work. Among the employees surveyed, 62.1% were very satisfied and 27.5% were satisfied. 
		These people accounted for the majority of the total number of employees interviewed. Only 8.2% of 
		employees think that this technology has not brought obvious effect, and the effect is very common, 
		only 2.2% of employees think that the application of this technology is very poor. The above results 
		show that: the application of <span id="mention-33" class="mention concept" about="bigdata" data-label="Big Data" data-wikidata-id="Q858810">big data</span> technology in Museum exhibition digitization can bring obvious 
		benefits to the work of museum staff.
