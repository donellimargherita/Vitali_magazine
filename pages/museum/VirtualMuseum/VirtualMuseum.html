				<p>I regularly work with museums to improve their use of technology to open up
				their collections, attract more visitors and build better relationships and the
				discussion usually turns to the impact of technology on museum content. How
				can a museum’s online content contribute to the wider aims of the museum
				and how the online museum content can fit within the broader museum
				definition. We normally end up asking more questions than we answer. Can a
				museum ever be solely online? Can online content improve conservation
				efforts? Is a visit to an online museums ever an acceptable replacement for
				physical visit?</p>
		
				<p>When we get into the detail of the argument surrounding online museums
				there is always a lot of questions around what ‘really’ constitutes a museum.
				So to start we need to ask the biggest question of all – “how do you define a
				museum?” and, as you would expect, the more people you ask the more
				complex and diverse the answers.</p>

				<h2><p class="subtitle">Is an online museum really a museum?</p></h2>
				</p>For the<span id="mention-10" class="mention organisation" about="Collins" data-label="Collins">Collins dictionary</span>the definition is short and sweet “A museum is a
				building where a large number of interesting and valuable objects, such as
				works of art or historical items, are kept, studied, and displayed to the public.”</p>
		
				<p>Whereas the<span id="mention-11" class="mention organisation" about="UKMuseumsAssociation" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">UK Museums Association</span>take a slightly more precise view and
				defines a museum under these criteria “’Museums enable people to explore
				collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment. They are institutions that
				collect, safeguard and make accessible artefacts and specimens, which they
				hold in trust for society. This definition includes art galleries with collections of
				works of art, as well as museums with historical collections of objects.”
		
				<p>You may think there isn’t much difference between the two definitions but
				there is one vital difference that, for me, gets to the heart of it. “A museum is a
				building” the dictionary proclaims but yet there are many institutions of
				learning, collections of artefacts and repositories of valuable and interesting
				objects that don’t require a physical space to define them. If we look at both
				definitions I am sure we can find numerous examples that fit the criteria but
				don’t demand a physical space.</p>
		
				<p>As the<span id="mention-12" class="mention organisation" about="UKMuseumsAssociation" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">UK Museums Association</span>says we are looking for “institutions that
				collect, safeguard and make accessible” and one thing that a physical building
				can sometimes limit is accessibility. An Online museum could actually improve
				access to the collections the museum is caring for, allowing people to find
				exhibitions that truly speak to them regardless of location and make links
				between artefacts held by museums and galleries on opposite sides of the
				world.</p>
		
				<p>So let’s put down aside our dictionary definition which requires a physical
				space and let’s look at what can be achieved if we are open to providing online
				museum content alongside our physical collections or in addition to the
				location-based services museums offer.</p>
		
				<h2><span class="subtitle">Could online museums help preserve our artefacts better?</span></h2>
				</p>The worlds most visited museum in<time datetime="2018">2018</time>was the<span id="mention-19" class="mention place" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q19675">Louvre</span>,<span id="mention-18" class="mention place" about="Paris" data-label="Paris" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Paris</span>which reported
				10.2 million visitors, a 25% increase from<time datetime="2017">2017</time>and the Physical space the
				<span id="mention-20" class="mention place" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Louvre</span>inhabits is both a help and a hindrance. The<span id="mention-21" class="mention place" about="Louvre" data-label="Louvre" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Louvre</span>is housed in an
				iconic building, in the centre of one of<span id="mention-22" class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>'s most visited cities and was
				featured in a well-documented music video for<span id="mention-2" class="mention person" about="Beyoncé" data-label="Beyoncé" data-sort="Beyoncé" data-wikidata-id="Q36153">Beyoncé</span>and<span id="mention-3" class="mention person" about="JayZ" data-label="Jay Z" data-sort="JayZ" data-wikidata-id="Q62766">Jay Z</span>'s single,
				Apeshit in which they use the physical space and collection as a backdrop for
				their contemporary dancers. The physical building contributes massively to its
				status as most visited museum and it’s hard to believe that an online museum
				might one day play host to a superstar who boosts their attendance by 25%
				year on year</p>

				<p>But this high growth in visitor volume may not be sustainable for many
				physical locations and, whilst many museums are yet to have an issue with too
				many visitors, there has been a lot of publicity in recent years surrounding high
				visitor numbers and locations closing to tourists altogether. These high volume
				tourist locations have been forced to change their ways of operating for the
				sake of the places and artefacts the space is meant to preserve and
				safeguard for future generations.</p>
		
				<p>In<time datetime="2018">2018</time>,<span id="mention-23" class="mention place" about="MachuPichu" data-label="Machu Pichu" data-wikidata-id="Q676203"> Machu Pichu</span>, a <span id="mention-13" class="mention organisation" about="UNESCO" data-label="UNESCO" data-wikidata-id="Q7809">Unesco</span> world heritage site in <span id="mention-24" class="mention place" about="Peru" data-label="Peru" data-wikidata-id="Q419"> brought in a 
				timed ticketing system which it hoped would alleviate the destruction
				caused by un-controlled visitation levels sometimes twice the
				recommended <span id="mention-14" class="mention organisation" about="UNESCO" data-label="UNESCO" data-wikidata-id="Q7809">Unesco</span> limit for the historic site. Whilst its impact is still
				being monitored they are hoping the requirement for a timede ticket will
				reduce the wear and tear on the historic environment.</p>
				
				<p>For some of the world's most valuable objects the mere act of display can
				be too much for it to be considered ethical to display the item at all.
				Whether its light, humidity or temperature, controlling the environment for
				some historical artefacts is paramount and not always compatible with the
				desire to show it to the public.</p>
		
				<p>The<span id="mention-25" class="mention place" about="VictoriaandAlbert" data-label="V&A" data-wikidata-id="Q213322">V&A</span>.<span id="mention-26" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> is home to the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-ardabil-carpet">Ardabil carpet</a> which is lit for only 10</p>
				minutes of each hour to allow visitors to see it without destroying the
				carpets rich colours and fine textures. The inclusion of the carpet in the
				online museum collection allows for more time to explore the carpet in close
				proximity which would never be possible in real life. This limited light for
				physical visitors combined with its online presence means it can be
				preserved for future generations and still be enjoyed by visitors today.</p>
		
				<p>As the world's population continues to grow, wee may need to look to
				alternatives to travelling to one physical location to share our historical
				collections, artefacts and works of art. If an online museum can allow
				content to be shared across the world whilst keeping the original cared for
				in perfect conditions out of sight of the public what impact could that have
				on other museum activities?</p>
		
				<h2><p class="subtitle">Content for everyone, everywhere</p></h2>
		
				<p>According to the most recent statistics from Internet World Statistics in
				<time datetime="April 2019">April 2019</time>, 56.1% of the world's population has internet access. Whilst
				some countries lag behind in internet connectivity or limit their residents
				access through censorship the amount of potential online museum visitors is
				still over 4.3 billion users.</p>
		
				<p>With the improvement in virtual reality we have seen in past few years
				it's not too far-fetched to think of a future where <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/article/bring-the-museum-to-the-classroom-with-virtual-reality-field-trips/">virtual schools trips</a> are
				taken by children wearing VR equipment in their classroom. where you
				could build you own <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/">virtual museum</a> and include your favourite artworks
				and artefacts from various collections in one place and feel like you are
				walking around the real, or imagined, museum in real time.</p>
		
				<p>But we don't need to even go that far to see how the online museum could
				bring content, learning and understanding to virtual visitors. Whether it be
				Facebook live events with live Q&A, virtual gallery tours hosted by
				exhibition curators or YouTube interviews with the artists themselves, there
				are hundreds of ways to connect your museum to your supporters with
				online content.</p>

				<p>In <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, the <span id="mention-27" class="mention place" about="NationalMuseumofAustralia" data-label="National Museum of Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q1967496"><a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/">National Museum of Australia</a> trialled a virtual museum tour
				which allowed online visitors to control a robot equipped with camera,
				speaker and microphone  and follow museum guides around the museum at
				their own pace. This new way of allowing remote visitors to interact with the
				museum online proved particularly popular with school children spread out
				all across Australia. These children, from as far away as a 4 hour flight
				across the country, could partake in a tour of their heritage and cultural
				artefacts without leaving their classroom. For these school children, who
				were unlikely to visit the physical museum, <a href="https://www.museumnext.com/article/making-museums-accessible-with-a-telepresence-robot/">using a robot to access the museum</a>
				proved a big hit and allowed them to participate in a way that
				would seem incredible to previous generations.</p>
	
				<p>Even without the need of robots, hi-tech gadgets and specialist
				equipment museums can turn their physical collections into online
				content with fantastic results. <span id="mention-4" class="mention person" about="NicholasCullinan" data-label="Nicholas Cullinan" data-sort="CullinanNicholas" data-wikidata-id="Q18753268">Nicholas Cullinan</span>, director of the
				<span id="mention-28" class="mention place" about="NationalPortraitGallery" data-label="National Portrait Gallery" data-wikidata-id="Q238587">National Portrait Gallery</span> in <span id="mention-29" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> told the <span id="mention-15" class="mention organisation" about="ArtNewspaper" data-label="Art Newspaper" data-wikidata-id="Q4070099">Art Newspaper</span> that
				visitor numbers to a museum's physical location were only part of
				the picture when interpreting the impact of a museum on its
				visitors. <span id="mention-5" class="mention person" about="NicholasCullinan" data-label="Nicholas Cullinan" data-sort="CullinanNicholas" data-wikidata-id="Q18753268">Nicholas</span> shared that "Half of our 1.2 million followers on
				social media and 42% of our five million annual web visits
				originate from outside the <span id="mention-30" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">UK</span>; these aree people who are unlikely
				to make a visit but are able to engage with the content we share.
				(A recent <span id="mention-16" class="mention organisation" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook" data-wikidata-id="Q355">Facebook</span> Live broadcast from our <span id="mention-6" class="mention person" about="ThomasGainsborough" data-label="Thomas Gainsborough" data-sort="GainsboroughThomas" data-wikidata-id="Q192720">Gainsborough</span>
				exhibition had 30,000 views, giving many more people access to
				curatorial expertise than could ever attend a tour in person.)"</p>
		
				<p>When <span id="mention-17" class="mention organisation" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook" data-wikidata-id="Q355">Facebook</span> and other social media platforms make it so
				easy to share content for your online museum you don't need to
				invest in too much new technology but can turn your attention to
				making the content you share as important as your physical
				collections. Again if we go back to our "what is a museum?"
				definition we may feel the purpose of our museum overall may be
				better met by taking our collections, art and artefacts to where
				the people are. The message is overwhelming, the people are
				increasingly online and if you want to reach them you may also
				need to work on the collections for your online museum. To allow
				people to access, study and make the most of your artefacts you
				have a duty to share those items with as many people as you can
				whether they can visit your physical location or not.</p>
		
				<h2><p class="subtitle">Could a museum be fully online?</p></h2>
				<p>It may surprise you to know that there are a number of resources
				online that consider themselves museums and have similar
				missions to, what most people would consider, a museum. And
				most importantly they definitely fit our definition put forward by
				the <span id="mention-18" class="mention organisation" about="UKMuseumsAssociation" data-label="UK Museums Association" data-wikidata-id="Q16931672">Museums Association</span> earlier.
		
				<p>Based in <span id="mention-31" class="mention place" about="Arizona" data-label="Arizona" data-wikidata-id="Q816">Arizona</span> the <span id="mention-32" class="mention place" about="TucsonLGBTQMuseum" data-label="Tucson LGBTQ Museum" data-wikidata-id="Q15961611""><a href="https://tucsongaymuseum.org/">Tucson LGBTQ Museum</a></span> is an online-only museum. Whilst
				it might not be the most technologically advanced online resource, the museum has
				been collecting, curating and caring for LGBTQ objects and artefacts since <time datetime="1967">1967</time>
				and today showcases the history of the LGBTQ movement and provides an online
				space to collate ideas, host exhibitions and provide historical content for research
				students. If we are looking for a community space where important artefacts are
				kept, cared for and displayed then this definitely fits the bill without requiring a
				building.</p>
		
				<p>For a more technologically advanced online museum we can look to the <span id="mention-33" class="mention place" about="InternetMuseumSweden" data-label="Internet Museum Sweden"><a href="https://www.internetmuseum.se/">Internet Museum, Sweden</a></span>
				which opened in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>. Designed to celebrate and document the
				Swedish history of the internet, this completely online resource aims to make the
				internet a better place whilst curating internet specific historical items and
				preserving <span id="mention-34" class="mention place" about="Sweden" data-label="Sweden" data-wikidata-id="Q34">Sweden</span>'s digital heritage. This museum obviously sees itself as a vital
				resource for our increasingly virtual world and, as it charts the history of probably
				the single biggest change to the way we live, I can all but guarantee it will become
				more important as time goes on.</p>
				
				<p>There are also some museums where the physical building was unable to continue
				but the content was still historically important to the community the museum
				served. The physical <span id="mention-35" class="mention place" about="St.George'sMuseum'" data-label="St. George's Museum">St. George's Museum</span> closed in the <time datetime="1950">1950</time>'s with <span id="mention-7" class="mention person" about="JohnRuskin" data-label="John Ruskin" data-sort="RuskinJohn" data-wikidata-id="Q179126">John Ruskin</span>'s
				collection being removed into various other museum collections or into storage. With
				the hope of reinstating this collection into a single location, the online museum was
				created to showcase the original museum’s collection, its contents and historical
				importance. The online museum project continues the work of its original founder to
				showcase the collection through images of the physical museum as it was originally
				curated.</p>
		
				<p>I would like to think that with the advances in technology museums would see an
				increase in online visitation and, at some point, be able to put in as much effort into
				their virtual content as they do in to the physical buildings and displays. With the
				promise of more potential visitors, contributors and supporters for the museum this
				makes sense but it also gives you unlimited space to curate, create and educate
				without constraints on visitor volume, accessibility of your building and care
				considerations for your more delicate items.</p>
		
				<p>If you can imagine that in the near future you could virtually visit any online museum
				from the comfort of your own home, store your favourite items in your own personal
				online museum collection or take a curator led tour with friends from across the
				world, we think you’ll agree that the online museum is soon to be a vital part of the museum eco-system.</p>
