		 <p><span id="mention-1" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">Digitization</span> has been a growing trend in museums that changes the entire concept of such technology and culture run parallel. Advances in one area help push the progression of the other. They each evolve over time and change the way that we interact them.
			 Technology has begun to shape our experiences in incredible ways. The speed of the changes is whatâ€™s most impressive. With modern technology, we have already begun to see shifts in how we experience museums.
			 Museums are seen as a staple when people think about culture. Museums hold significant amounts of information about a particular city or country, including its history, society evolution, notable people, and much more. Museums have always been a major destination for understanding more about where you are and the impact that culture has had on us all. With recent advances affecting museums, it is worth examining the way we could interact with museums of the future.
			 Before, the only way to experience a museum and its offerings was to actually visit the physical location. If there was a particular painting that you wanted to see, the only option was to take a trip to the gallery that held it, this could even be in a different country. Museums are always must-see activities for tourists to major cities in order to get an inside look of where they are visiting.</p>

		 	<p>The effects of <span id="mention-2" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">digitization</span> are creating a revolutionary way to experience any museum, possibly better than going to the physical location. <span id="mention-3" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">Digitization</span> is when a museum takes its collections and renders them to post online. There are <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/what-digitization-will-do-for-the-future-of-museums-2454655/">various ways</a> of digitizing a collection depending on the medium. Flat prints and paintings are the simplest to digitize with just <span id="mention-10" class="mention tool" about="scanning" data-label="scanning" data-wikidata-id="Q11873863">scanning</span> the actual image. Museums have also begun to digitize actual sculpture with <span id="mention-11" class="mention tool" about="3Drenderings" data-label="3-D renderings" data-wikidata-id="Q16911860">3-D renderings</span> to capture the detail of every angle of the art piece.
		 	There have been many museums that have embarked on <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/technology/step-van-gogh-virtual-reality-tribute-his-famous-paintings/">multi-year projects</a> to digitize their entire collections. Digitizing is an entire process that can take time to actually <span id="mention-12" class="mention tool" about="scanning" data-label="scanning" data-wikidata-id="Q11873863">scan</span> and capture the essence of a piece. Many museums have already begun to host collections online through <span id="mention-4" class="mention concept" about="opensource" data-label="open source" data-wikidata-id="Q39162">open source</span> content which allows users to download and make edits to any digitized art available.</p>

			 <p>Some of the museums that have been making significant process in digitizing their collections include the <span id="mention-19" class="mention organisation" about="METMuseum" data-label="MET Museum" data-wikidata-id="Q160236">MET Museum</span> in <span id="mention-17" class="mention place" about="NYC" data-label="NYC" data-wikidata-id="Q60">NYC 17</span>, <span id="mention-20" class="mention organisation" about="NationalGalleryofArt" data-label="National Gallery of Art" data-wikidata-id="Q214867">National Gallery of Art</span> in <span id="mention-18" class="mention place" about="WashingtonDC" data-label="Washington DC" data-wikidata-id="Q61">Washington, DC</span>, the <span id="mention-21" class="mention organisation" about="VaticanLibrary" data-label="Vatican Library" data-wikidata-id="Q213678">Vatican Library</span>, the <span id="mention-22" class="mention organisation" about="Smithsonian" data-label="Smithsonian" data-wikidata-id="Q131626">Smithsonian</span>, the <span id="mention-23" class="mention organisation" about="TaiwaneseMuseum" data-label="Taiwanese Museum">Taiwanese Museum</span>, and many more. These museums hold upwards of millions of individual pieces of art and have already successfully digitized tens to hundreds of thousands of pieces which are currently available online. These are among the top museums in terms of visitors and unique collections so you can be sure that the addition of the digital collection has changed how people interact with them.</p>
			 <h2><p>Clear benefits</p></h2>
			 <p>There are several benefits that help continue to push museum forward to eventually digitizing their entire collections. One of the benefits to digitizing an art collection is for research purposes. A <a href="https://nuadox.com/post/171393381062/virtual-archaeology">recent article</a> came out discussing how two museums held different sides to a historic tablet but with the help of <span id="mention-13" class="mention tool" about="virtualrendition" data-label="virtual rendition">virtual renditions</span>of the tablet sides, researchers were able to digitally combine them and translate the text. Cases such as this is important for truly understanding the possible value of a piece of art.</p>

			 <p>Another benefit to art<span id="mention-5" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">digitization</span> is <span id="mention-6" class="mention concept" about="accessibility" data-label="accessibility"  data-wikidata-id="Q555097">accessibility</span>. There are many people interested in art but do not have the means to travel around the world to see the most world-renowned paintings or sculptures. Now, we all have access to high resolution copies of the actual work of art. Sometimes, these online views provide a much better viewing experience than actually visiting the museum. A physical museum may have large crows and it can be difficult to read the brief information provided about a particular piece. With an <span id="mention-14" class="mention tool" about="onlinedatabase" data-label="online database" data-wikidata-id="Q7094076">online database</span>, you not only have a clear view of the artwork, but also a database can provide multimedia information about the piece, the artist, etc. which can include text, videos, related information and much more.</p>
			 <h2><p class="subtitle"><span id="mention-7" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">Digitization</span> can be controversial</p></h2>
			 <p>Some of the benefits have been controversial, especially for true historic art lovers. Some of the uses for digitizing a work of art in a museum is for the purpose of heightening the experience of it. There have been museum statues that have been digitized and animated into a moving figure. There are also famous paintings that have been digitized and converted into <span id="mention-15" class="mention tool" about="virtualreality" data-label="virtual reality" data-wikidata-id="Q170519">virtual reality</span> settings where you can literally explore the inside of the painting. Although this can be an exciting way to experience an old piece of art, it can be seen as sacrificing the integrity of the original piece of art. If more people begin to enjoy these enhanced digital copies of art, then the actual physical piece would lose its appeal.
		 	 We are only in the beginning stages of digitizing art. More and more museums are beginning to digitize their collections as the appropriate technology becomes more accessible. Whether you view this <span id="mention-8" class="mention concept" about="digitization" data-label="digitization" data-wikidata-id="Q843958">digitization</span> movement as a positive to the art world or as hurting the art world, one thing for sure is that at this pace, we will soon have a completely new meaning of museums and how we view their exhibits.</p>
